# Cortex: end-week

This is a thin host adapter. Starting from this loaded `SKILL.md` file, walk upward to the nearest directory containing `AGENTS.md`, `commands/end-week.md`, and `scripts/cortex_cli.py`; call it `<cortex-repo-root>`. Do not assume the current working directory is the Cortex repository. If no such root is readable, stop.

Read `<cortex-repo-root>/AGENTS.md`, `<cortex-repo-root>/commands/end-week.md`, `<cortex-repo-root>/references/core-contract.md`, and the current host's column (Claude Code, Cowork, Codex, or ChatGPT Work) in `<cortex-repo-root>/references/capability-matrix.md` completely before acting. The command file is the workflow authority. If those sources conflict, stop and report the conflict instead of inventing behavior.

## Invocation

On Claude, use the text following `/end-week`; on Codex, use the text following `$end-week`; in ChatGPT Work, use the user's text after selecting Cortex or this skill with `@`. Natural-language activation is also allowed when the request clearly matches the description.

## Host binding

1. Resolve `<config-root>` through the shared `scripts/lib/config_root.py` precedence chain. On filesystem-capable hosts, `<cortex-repo-root>/hooks/session_start.py --print-root` is available. In cloud Work, call `cortex_status`; the MCP bridge resolves the same chain on the machine that owns the memory. Do not create a host-specific pointer.
2. Require `filesystem.read` for memory access. On Claude Code, Codex, or Local Work, the resolved root must be inside the host's readable/writable roots as appropriate; Cowork requests its directory grant. In cloud Work, use `cortex_recall` and `cortex_search`; never claim direct access to device files.
3. Bind every optional operation through `references/capability-matrix.md`. Skip unavailable connectors, web search, scheduling, artifacts, or delegation exactly as that capability's degrade rule says.
4. Treat model-tier names in the canonical workflow as cost/latency intent. Use a host-available low-cost/fast model when possible; otherwise run inline and disclose the degradation.

## Mutation boundary

For every local write under `<config-root>/memory/`, shell out to `<cortex-repo-root>/scripts/cortex_cli.py` or import the existing implementation from `<cortex-repo-root>/scripts/lib/`. In cloud Work, use `cortex_configure` only for a confirmed first-run pointer setup; for memory mutations use only `cortex_add_note`, `cortex_update_section`, `cortex_reindex`, and `cortex_refresh_hot`. Show the exact proposed change and obtain confirmation before setting `user_confirmed=true`. Replacing an existing pointer requires a separate confirmation before `force_pointer=true`. The bridge intentionally has no move, delete, append-line, or whole-file-write tool; preview or skip those steps. Never hand-edit memory files and never reimplement locking, atomic replacement, index generation, or hot-cache generation.

If the canonical step has no deterministic CLI/library path, show a proposed change or skip that step; do not turn prose into an unreviewed write. Session-end hooks are best-effort reminders, never proof that `/remember` completed.

## Adapter status: partial

This adapter is intentionally partial. Never imply that its unavailable steps completed. This orchestration depends on partially wired child workflows and optional sibling plugins. In ChatGPT Work, preview or skip any step for which the bounded MCP bridge has no mutation tool.

End with a concise account of what was read, what changed, which optional capabilities were unavailable, and which partial steps were left unapplied.
