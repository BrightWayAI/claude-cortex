## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [3.0.1]

### Added
- MIT `LICENSE` file (matches `plugin.json` license field).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` as the canonical version history (README changelog remains a summary).
- GitHub issue templates (bug report, feature request) and pull request template.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` describing command/skill flow and memory layout.
- CI workflow **Validate** — JSON checks for `plugin.json`, frontmatter checks for command/skill markdown (and `.claude/commands` when present).
- `scripts/check_repo.py` used by CI.

## [3.0.0]

### Added
- **File-based storage** — memory now persists to `~/Documents/Claude/memory/` as markdown files.
- Two-tier structure: `DASHBOARD.md` for fast orientation + individual node files for detail.
- Node-to-file mapping: `client:acme-corp` → `memory/client/acme-corp.md`.
- Directories created dynamically from node prefixes — any prefix is valid.
- Every write operation updates both the node file and the dashboard.
- Archive support: `/forget --archive` moves files to `memory/archive/`.
- `/cleanup` now audits actual files on disk, detects orphaned entries and missing files.
- All 9 commands updated with explicit storage instructions.

## [2.2.0]

### Changed
- **Business-operator friendly** — all examples, taxonomy, and language updated for general business use (not just technical projects).
- Node conventions now lead with client work, bizdev, strategy, and ops.
- Added strategy/planning node type (`strategy:q2-growth`, `strategy:pricing`).
- All knowledge examples rewritten for business contexts (proposals, procurement, pricing, onboarding, retention).

## [2.1.0]

### Added
- **Knowledge-first redesign** — memory now captures insights, lessons, mental models, gotchas, recipes, and corrected beliefs as first-class entry types.
- `/learn` — quick knowledge capture without full session extraction.
- `/note` — one-liner capture for quick facts.
- `/review` — synthesized weekly digest with "Learned" as a prominent section.

### Changed
- `/recall` now surfaces knowledge entries prominently (not buried under project state).
- `/recall [topic]` — topic-based knowledge recall across all projects.
- `/search` redesigned to prioritize knowledge entries for "how/what/why" queries.
- `/remember` extraction expanded to cover both project state and knowledge categories.
- Knowledge entries preserved longer than logs during memory consolidation.

## [2.0.0]

### Added
- `/search`, `/forget`, `/timeline`, `/cleanup` commands.
- Priority system, staleness tracking, blocker tracking, people index.
- Genericized taxonomy, cross-project signals.

## [1.0.0]

### Added
- Initial release with `/remember` and `/recall`.
